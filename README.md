### Hi there 👋

👨‍💻 Studying MS in Applied Computer Science at NWMSU
🌐 Exploring Web Application Development with GitHub
💡 Learning, coding, and pushing the limits!
🔗 Ask me anything about GitHub! 

📚 Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University (NWMSU). My passion lies in web application development, and I'm constantly diving into new topics, frameworks, and technologies to expand my skills.

🌟 GitHub is my playground, where I turn ideas into code and collaborate with fellow developers. I'm always excited to discuss GitHub, version control, repositories, and best practices. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat tech!

🚀 Let's connect and innovate together through the power of code! 🌐
